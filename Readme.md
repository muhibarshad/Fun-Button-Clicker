# My First Java GUI Program: Fun Button Clicker

This is my first simple Java GUI program, demonstrating basic concepts of Swing and event handling. The program features a "Yes" button and a "No" button. When the "Yes" button is clicked, it displays a congratulatory message in a dialog box. The "No" button, however, has a funny and interesting functionality â€“ it moves around the frame every time it's clicked or hovered over!
